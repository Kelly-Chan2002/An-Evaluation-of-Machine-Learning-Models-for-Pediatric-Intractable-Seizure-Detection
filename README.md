This project will be a comprehensive overview of how to implement basic seizure detection for beginners and those who are computationally limited using the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database. The code provided is ready to run, and easy to modify, allowing it to adapt to numerous classification training models. It contains several explainability features, such as bar diagrams and confusion matrices for better understanding.
